# particle-experiment

A simple experiment making use of Newtonian gravitational attraction and repellence

# Info

Every particle in the scene is either gravitationally attracted, reppeled or not affected by all the others around it, which is determined using [Newtons formula for gravitational attraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation). This mix of both reppellance and attraction helps to create stable shapes and interesting interactions between each of the differently coloured particles.

# Controls

**Left Click / Touch**: Causes nearby particles to be attracted towards the cursor / touch position

**Right Click**: Causes nearby particles to be forced away from the cursor

---

**Attract**: Controls which particles will be affected when you right or left click

**Gravity**: Controls the force caused by gravity of the particles, I reccomend leaving this at 0

**Drag**: Controls the amount of velocity lost by the particles to friction, the larger the number the more energy that is lost (This helps to control the particles)

**Particle Matrix**: Clicking this button will toggle the particle matrix. The attraction matrix represents the strengths of the attractions between each of the coloured particles and the mass matrix represents the mass of each of the coloured particles
